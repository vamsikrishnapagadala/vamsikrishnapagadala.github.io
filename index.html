									<ul>
									<li>“Syntax and Semantic Analysis of Text for Human-Computer Interaction” under the guidance of Dr. Erik Cambria (Associate Professor, School of Computer Science and Engineering, NTU).</li>	
									<li>The Research is based on enhancing the interaction system between Human and the Computer using Machine Learning and Data Analysis.</li>
									<li>Built a Dataset containing different words, idioms and Phrases using the help of multiple sources, to analyze the polarity, similarity, and the sentiment of the data. As the Idioms and Phrases have different sentiment according to the words used but their meaning is different.</li>
									<li>These Idioms and Phrases are used to train Computers for a better Human and Computer Interaction using Senticnet 6.0.</li>
									<li>I have collected large amounts of tweets including emojis from Twitter regarding major trending topics of that time, analyzed the data’s including emojis polarity and similarity to find out the sentiment of the data. With all that information I created multiple visual charts that indicate the twitterati’s sentiment over that trending topic.</li>

								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>

								<h3 >Masking Sensitive Data using NLP (Master's Project TTU)</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/nlp.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										•	Creation of Scam call datasets manually, i.e., recording calls with sentiments, as there not many transcribed call datasets available on the Internet where we can work on. In future the call datasets can be used for Sentiment analysis and train the computer on identifying scam calls on the sentiment of the caller and the information being transferred during the call.<br>
										•	Identification and masking of Sensitive Data using Natural Language Tool Kit.<br>
										•	TFIDF Vectorization- Converted transcribed call data into tokens of tokens and then vectorized the data to get values according to the data.<br>
										•	Cosine similarity- Created new datasets for phone number, names, states etc., and vectorized them to get values and compared those values with the values obtained from the vectorization of transcribed call data using cosine similarity to find sensitive data.<br>
										•	Regular Expressions- This is another method to Identify and mask sensitive data. Here we used regular expression such as zip_code="^[1-9][0-9]{3}[1-8]$" for finding zip codes in the transcribed call dataset and mask it.<br>
									</p>

								<h3 >Web Application (Student Activities Council)</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/SAC.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									•	Designed and developed an application (yet to be published) for the student council for Vignan’s university.<br>
									•	The application was built using Hyper Text Markup Language and the designing and texture was built using Cascading Style Sheets.<br>
									•	I have used local database as well which has been connected to the application using NetBeans which works with Java Script.<br>
								</p>

								<h3 >Satellite positioning/tracking using Rabin-Karp String Matching</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/satellite.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									•	I developed an application where it has all the coordinates (x, y, z) i.e., three-dimensional position of the satellite that is in space. This would help us track the position of the satellite from time to time.
									•	When a new satellite is being launched, there must be a particular position where the satellite will be placed. The Rabin Karp string matching algorithm will be used here to analyze all the positions of the satellite and find a perfect spot for the new satellite in space at a desired level z, and the algorithm is good in finding duplicates so, the satellite has a unique new position, so it does not collide with the other satellites.
									•	This application is limited to geosynchronous satellites.

								</p>

								<h3 >End-to-End Encryption using C language</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/e2e.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									•	Simple encryption system has been used to encrypt data that is transmitted between two people. 
									•	I have created two accounts where each account has its own account name and password. 
									•	When a person logs in to the account, they are asked if they want to send a message to anyone. If they want to, they are asked to type the message and enter the recipient. The recipient logs in to see that he received a message and puts in the key that he has from the sender to get the original message back.
									

								</p>

								<h3 >FirstAid Assistance using Alexa</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/alexa.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The project motto is to provide steps for first aid through voice assistant Alexa.  It Provides  step by step instructions with the  invocation word “First aid”along with “type of the First aid”. AWS lambda function and NLP are leveraged to achieve the needed functionality.</p>

								<h3 >Pacman Berkeley AI</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pcman.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Multi-programmed ghosts using different path finding algorithms. Automatic movement for PacMan as well as user-controlled and Reinforcement Learning activities from <a href=" http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html" target="_blank">Berkeley AI</a> materials</p>
